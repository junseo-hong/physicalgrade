Military Physical Grade Calculator website where you can calculate your Korean Military Physical grade in just a few clicks!

## Details about the website
I made this website while I was serving my Military duties in the Republic of Korea Army. What the website does is it calculates the military physical grade based on user
selection of inputs, which can range from Grade 1 to Grade 5. If you get Grade 4 or above, you are exempt from joining the Army. I felt the necessity to create this website
because I, personally, learned that I was Grade 4 only after I joined the army. Then, I came across numerous other soliders in my battalion who were in the same shoes as I was, which means
only if they had spent time to examine their physical grade sooner, they would be where they actually belong according to their physical conditions. 

This became the motive to
teach myself frontend basics such as HTML, Javascript, CSS and MongdoDB to create a full-stack website that can easily and accessibly calculate one's physical grade estimate, which was something that should have been made 
available to all korean males, but had been missing. To this date, the physicalgrade website has helped more than 1,800+ people calculate their physical grade estimate which I hope, has helped numerous people be aware of their actual physical grade and
allowed them to explore other career options instead of being forced to enlist in the army at their disadvantage, like myself and some of my colleagues in my battalion!
