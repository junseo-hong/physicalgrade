Military Physical Grade Calculator website where you can calculate your military eligibiliy in just a few clicks.

## Details about the website
I made this website while I was serving my Military duties in the Republic of Korea Army. What the website does is it calculates the military physical grade estimate based on
selection of user inputs from the pre-initialized list of diseases/physical conditions, which can result in a Military Physical grade ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 5. If you get Grade 4 or above, you are exempt from joining the Republic of Korea Armed Forces legally. I felt the necessity to create this website
because I, personally, learned that I was Grade 4 only after I joined the army. Additionally, I came across numerous other soldiers in my battalion who were in the same shoes as I was, which means
only if they had known their actual physical grades sooner, they would not have to join the Army needlessly according to their physical conditions. 

This became my motive to
teach myself web development tools such as HTML, Javascript, CSS and MongdoDB to create a full-stack website within the army, which can easily and accessibly calculate one's physical grade estimate, which was something that should have been made 
available to all korean males, but had been missing the entire time. To this date, the physicalgrade website has helped more than 1,800+ potential soldiers calculate their physical grade estimate, which I hope has helped numerous people be aware of their actual physical grade and
allowed them to explore other career options, instead of being forced to enlist in the army at their disadvantage like myself and my colleagues in my battalion!
